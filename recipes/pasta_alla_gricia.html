  <h3>Description</h3>
  Discover how to make the underappreciated Pasta all Gricia, a minimalist perfection of rigatoni dressed in a silky emulsion of rich guanciale fat and starchy pasta water.
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>225g guanciale
    <li>extra virgin olive oil
    <li>60g Pecorino cheese, plus more for serving
    <li>350g Rigatoni
    <li>salt and pepper
  </ul>

  <h3>Method</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Freeze the guanciale for at least 15 minutes, and up to 45 minutes (partially freezing the guanciale makes it easier to slice). Using a sharp chef's knife, cut into 1/4-inch-thick planks, then cut planks into 1/4-inch-thick batons (lardons).
    <li>In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-low heat until shimmering. Add guanciale and cook, stirring occasionally, until fat has rendered and guanciale is golden brown and crisp, about 15 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer guanciale to a plate; set aside. Reduce heat to low, and bloom about 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper in rendered guanciale fat until pepper foams and is aromatic, about 1 minute. Remove skillet from heat.
    <li>Meanwhile, bring some water to boil in a large pot. Set a colander inside a large heatproof bowl in the sink. Add rigatoni to water and cook, stirring frequently during the first minute to prevent pasta from sticking.
    <li>Once the pasta has cooked for 4 minutes 30 seconds, transfer 475ml of starchy pasta water to skillet. Return skillet to high heat and bring to a boil, swirling to emulsify pasta water with guanciale fat.
    <li>When the pasta has cooked for a total of 5 minutes, drain in prepared colander, then transfer the pasta to the skillet (the pasta will be very undercooked at this point, but it will continue cooking in the skillet); reserve drained pasta water.
    <li>Cook the rigatoni, swirling skillet constantly and gently stirring with a spoon or rubber spatula, to ensure even cooking and that the sauce remains emulsified, until pasta is al dente and sauce is thickened and reduced, 6 to 8 minutes; if sauce reduces too much before pasta has finished cooking, add more reserved pasta water to skillet in 1/4-cup increments. Add the guanciale to skillet and carefully toss to combine.
    <li>Remove from heat, add half of the grated Pecorino, and toss or stir rapidly to combine. Once cheese is fully emulsified in the sauce, add remaining Pecorino Romano, and toss or stir rapidly once more to combine. Adjust sauce consistency as needed with more pasta water. Season with salt and pepper, if needed. Serve right away, passing more cheese at the table.
