  <h3>Description</h3>
  Discover how to make superb spaghetti carbonara. This cheesy pasta dish is an Italian favourite and with the right technique, you can make it perfect every time.
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>100g pancetta
    <li>100g parmesan cheese
    <li>3 eggs
    <li>350g spaghetti
    <li>50g butter
    <li>salt and pepper
  </ul>

  <h3>Method</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.
    <li>Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind.
    <li>Finely grate the parmesan cheese.
    <li>Beat the 3 eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside.
    <li>Salt the boiling water, add the 350g spaghetti, and cook for 10 minutes or until al dente.
    <li>While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta in the butter. Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp.
    <li>Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet.
    <li>Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.
    <li>Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.
    <li>Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.
    <li>Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.
